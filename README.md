# GR13_Speech_recognition

## 2 code versions:
* Windows
* MacOS, Linux

the difference lies in one line of code in the filename splitting process. Windows uses backslashes ( \ ) for paths to directories, while MacOS (and Linux) use the forward slash ( / ). This difference plays a major role in the filename splitting process in our project.

## Python libraries used:
* Librosa
* Scikit Learn
* Numpy
